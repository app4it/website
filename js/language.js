        storyText1: "App4it entstand aus einer simplen Frustration: Trotz all der Technologie, die uns zur Verfügung steht, war es immer noch schwer, echte Verbindungen zu knüpfen und lokale Events zu finden. Das wollten wir ändern. Unsere Reise begann in einer kleinen Stadt, wo wir hautnah erlebten, wie leicht man sich isoliert fühlt – selbst wenn man von Menschen umgeben ist.",
        storyText2: "Wir sind vier Entwickler mit unterschiedlichen Hintergründen – Frontend, Backend, KI, UX – aber einem gemeinsamen Ziel: Etwas zu bauen, das Menschen in der echten Welt zusammenbringt. Wir glauben, dass Technologie dir helfen sollte rauszugehen, statt dich an den Bildschirm zu kleben. Deshalb machen wir es dir leicht zu entdecken, was in deiner Umgebung passiert, und neue Leute zu treffen, die deine Interessen teilen.",
        storyText3: "Das ist für uns nicht nur eine App – es ist eine Mission. Wir bauen App4it für alle, die mehr von ihrer Stadt, mehr von ihrem sozialen Leben und mehr von Technologie wollen. Wir hoffen, dass du dabei bist, wenn wir eine Community schaffen, in der echte menschliche Verbindungen an erster Stelle stehen.",
