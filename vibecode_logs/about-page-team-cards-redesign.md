# About Page Team Section - Business Card Layout Redesign

## Initial Prompt
"let's work now on the "meet the team" section. let's edit the layout of the cards. The cards are now presented as if they were business cards that are usually handed in hand. The layout is the following:

The card is divided vertically in three spaces: person overview, details, and fun fact.

The person overview displays: person picture, name, profession title and link to social medias. 
The picture is displayed at the left, on a circle avatar. The name is displayed at the right, at the top, in bold font. Below it, there's the profession. This has smaller font and its color is a variation of the primary color, with less saturation. Below it, there's the icons with the links to social media. These icons are normal filled icons, without a background behind them.

After this, there is the description text. This text uses normal font, but a bit greyed out.

After this, there's the fun fact. This is a container with a very light background, the background has a gradient with primary and secondary color, but with very low opacity and lower saturation. 
The content is two elements on a row. at the left, there's a small circle of secondary color. Vertically aligned to the top. At the right, there's the title "fun fact" and the text with a fun fact about us.

The "fun fact" section is only visible while the person hovers the card.  otherwise it displays a blank space. On hover, the cards have other effects.
- The profile picture increases it size slightly.
- An outline border appears around the picture. The color of this border is the same as the text on the right.
- A small circle appears below the picture, at the right, stacked on it. This circle usually indicates that a person is online. This circle is of color gradient between primary and secondary colors.
- The name changes its color, to match the color of the text below it (with the position of the person), the same color as the border of the picture while on hover too.
